# Loan Repayment Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a loan applicant is likely to **repay the loan** or **default**, using the **Decision Tree Classifier algorithm**. It is a use case designed to assist **bank managers** in making informed decisions based on applicant data.

## 📌 Use Case

A **bank manager** is looking for a data-driven approach to assess loan applications. By analyzing historical data of previous applicants, this model helps predict the repayment behavior of new applicants.

## 🧠 Objective

To develop a machine learning model using the **Decision Tree Classifier** to:
- Analyze past loan data
- Identify key features affecting repayment
- Predict loan repayment status (Yes/No)

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains information such as:

- loan amount
- applicant's income
- credit history
- employment status


---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

---

## 📊 Model Used

**Decision Tree Classifier**  
Chosen for its:
- Simplicity and interpretability
- Ability to handle both numerical and categorical data
- Suitability for classification problems

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and understand patterns
3. **Feature Selection**: Choose features that impact loan repayment
4. **Model Building**: Train a Decision Tree Classifier
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall
6. **Prediction**: Make predictions on test data or new input
